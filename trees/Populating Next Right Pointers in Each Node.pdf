Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Approach:
just bfs level-wise, map each node to its neighbouring right node in a level order traversal

time O(n)
space O(n)

Approach:
    1
   / \
  2   3
  /\  /\
  4 5 6 7

for every node, node.left.next = node.right

but wat about neigbouring children
from this logic 4->5 and 6->7 but wat about 5->6?

its easy, we know 2->3 therefore 2.right.next = 2.next.left

follow this approach.
