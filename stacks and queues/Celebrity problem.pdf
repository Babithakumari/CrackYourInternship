Brute Force Approach
Intuition

 The idea is to model the solution using graphs. Initialize indegree and outdegree of every vertex as 0. If A knows B, draw a directed edge from A to B, increase indegree of B and outdegree of A by 1. Construct all possible edges of the graph for every possible pair [i, j]. There are NC2 pairs. If a celebrity is present in the party, there will be one sink node in the graph with outdegree of zero and indegree of N-1. 
Implementation

    Create two arrays indegree and outdegree, to store the indegree and outdegree
    Run a nested loop, the outer loop from 0 to n and inner loop from 0 to n.
    For every pair i, j check if i knows j then increase the outdegree of i and indegree of j
    For every pair i, j check if j knows i then increase the outdegree of j and indegree of i
    Run a loop from 0 to n and find the id where the indegree is n-1 and outdegree is 0.
