approach:
1) find all cells containing rotten oranges, also count no of fresh oranges
2) while queue and fresh:
        for each entry in queue at current instance:
            find its neigbours, if fresh, mark as rotten, add to queue, decrement fresh

        increment time

3) return time if fresh=0 else return -1
