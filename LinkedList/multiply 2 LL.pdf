Given elements as nodes of the two linked lists. The task is to multiply these two linked lists, say L1 and L2. 

Note: The output could be large take modulo 109+7.

Approach:
1) get the integer form of the linked list. 1-> 2-> 3 becomes 123
similarly for L2
return product of the 2 numbers


CODE:
def multiplyTwoList(head1, head2):
    # Code here
    num1 = 0
    num2 = 0
    
    while head1 or head2:
        if head1:
           num1 = (num1*10) + head1.data
           head1 = head1.next
           
        if head2:
           num2 = (num2*10) + head2.data
           head2 = head2.next
           
           
    return (num1 * num2) % MOD
